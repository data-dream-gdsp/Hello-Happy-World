You are asked to provide a set of 30 diverse task instructions. These task instructions will be provided to an LLM model, and we will evaluate the LLM model's ability to complete these instructions.
Data: {}
Here are the requirements:
1. For maximum variety, try to avoid reusing verbs in each indicator.
2. The language used for instructions should also be diverse. For example, you should combine questions with imperative instructions.
3. The types of instructions should be diverse. The list should include various types of tasks, such as open generation, classification, editing, etc.
4. The GPT language model should be able to complete the instructions. For example, don't let the assistant create any visual or audio output. As another example, don't ask the assistant to wake you up at 5pm or set reminders because it can't perform any actions.
5. Instructions should be written in English.
6. Instructions should be 1 to 2 sentences long. Imperative or question sentences are allowed.
7. You should generate an appropriate input to give instructions. The input fields should contain specific examples provided for the instructions. It should involve real-world data and should not contain simple placeholders. The input should provide substance to make the instructions challenging, but preferably no more than 100 words.
8. Not all instructions need to be entered. For example, when a directive asks for some general information, such as "what is the highest peak in the world," there is no need to provide specific context. In this case, we simply place "<noinput>" in the input field.
9. Outputs shall be appropriate responses to instructions and inputs. Make sure the output does not exceed 100 words.
10. Make sure the output is grammatically correct and include punctuation if necessary.
